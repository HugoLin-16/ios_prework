## App Brainstorming (Step 4)
Application:
- Instagram
  - vanish mode
- Messenger
  - change text box color
- Gmail
  - switch account easily
 
I have some ideas about improving the existing WeChat app. I want to add a few features to the app such as people will be able to know if other people have read their messages and if other have unfriend them or not.

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
